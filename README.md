# Linked-List
Program that adds two linked lists together to store larger than usual data types 

Values are added to the program via cin. Each sequential value goes to list1, then list2, then can be ended with an empty enter. These two lists are then added via a sumList() function, which is then printed out to the user.  

This program practices object-oriented programming, pointers, and the data-type of linked lists.
